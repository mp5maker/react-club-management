# React Club Management

* Please use yarn for this app
* Node Version v14.18.0
* NPM Version 6.14.15

## How the project is setup

> Backend => Node + Typescript
> Frontend => Create React App with typescript template

## Starting the App

> Please run the commands from the root directory [Do not need to go to frontend or backend directory]
> Frontend runs in PORT:3000
> Backend runs in PORT:4000
> Database runs in PORT:5000 [Fake Database]

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Some Considerations [Due to time limitations]

> Please use yarn [instead of npm]
> Avoided using Material-UI or styled components (styling has been done using scss)
> Avoided using raw webpack, instead create-react-app was used
> Apologize if there are any wrong translations for Lithuanian word
> External Libraries used for calendar, didn't had the time to make it
> Supports for Internet Explorer 11 or prior Safari 14.1. (Please use the modern browsers)
